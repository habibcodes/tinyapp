# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a responsive full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Streamlined and efficient, TinyApp allows users to quickly format lengthy URLs and store them in a private account. The great thing is that creating an account is absolutely FREE and every user gets enough storage for hundreds of thousands of URL storage!
